Project 1: building a Lexer/Scanner

The program is a scanner of user input via input_scode.txt file. User can put any piece of code into the input_scode.txt file, then the program would execute, scanning through all the code in the text file, sorting out each lexeme, categorizing it into token, and displaying them in the output.txt.

The program is written in C++. The Main() block would read the input_scode.txt file and sort out each lexeme, as well as removing all white space. The lexer() function would put each lexeme into a category of token and display the token/lexeme table on the output.txt file.
